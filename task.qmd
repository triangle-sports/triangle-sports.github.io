## 2024-2025

### Objective

Predict `point spread` together with a `95% confidence interval` in the 2025 NCAA conference games for Duke, NC State and UNC, Chapel Hill. 

### Instructions

1. Download a copy of the google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MoSm6rSKa4zIemlunDs1O6m77oSbXa2klaqFYWPLOxc/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Only edit the light blue cells** to input your predictions and team name. Make a prediction for each of the 55 games. 

:::callout-important
Enter all values to two decimal places.

- Enter the point spread of team 1 over team 2 in the `point_spread` column.
- Enter the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval in the `ci_95_lb` column.
- Enter the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval in the `ci_95_ub` column.

3. Click `File`, `Download`, `Comma Separated Values (.csv)` to download your prediction spreadsheet. Rename your file to the name of your team. Upload your file to the dropbox link [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3rRzJVPdjfrjywYuXSm0). **Make sure your file type is a** `csv`.

### Evaluation

Your accuracy and precision predictions (point estimate and confidence intervals respectively) will be evaluated separately by two metrics described below.

1. Mean Absolute Error

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \mu_i - \hat{\mu}_i \right|
$$

where $\mu_i$ is the actual point spread outcome (home - away points) and $\hat{\mu}_i$ is your predicted point spread for the $i$th game. The average is taken over all $n = 58$ total games that you are predicting the outcome for. In words, the mean absolute error is the average number of points your predictions are away from the truth.

2. Confidence Interval Distance

<!-- To reward tighter confidence intervals, we will use the following metric: -->
