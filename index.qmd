### About

The 2nd annual **Triangle Sports Analytics Competition** aims to bring
together students from Duke, UNC, Chapel Hill, and NC State who love
sports analytics to compete in a prediction contest. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to compete. The scope of the competition is to predict all **ACC Men's Basketball** games between **February 7, 2026** and **March 7, 2026**. **Students may work individually or in a team of 2-5**.

### Competition

- Point spread is the difference in points scored between Home and Away teams. Your job is to create a statistical model that predicts the point spread of ACC Men's Basketball games. [Click here to learn more](/task.html#Objective)
