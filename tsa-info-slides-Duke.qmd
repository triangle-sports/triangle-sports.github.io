## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated according to three metrics:

MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \mu_i - \hat{\mu}_i \right|
$$

. . . 

2. Confidence interval width (CIW) 

$$
CIW = \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| ub_i - lb_i \right|,& \text{if Coverage} \geq 70\% \\
    & \\
    \text{Disqualified (DQ)},              & \text{if Coverage} < 70\%
\end{cases}
$$
