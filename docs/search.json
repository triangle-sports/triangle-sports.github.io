A computer with R or Python and a basic background with linear models is ideal.\n\n\nIs there a prize for the winners?\nAt this current point in time, there is no prize for the winners. This could change but there is no guarantee. This is an excellent, exciting opportunity to build your resume with essential data science skills. The photos of the winning teams in each category will be displayed on this website as long as this competition exists.\n\n\nOther questions\nFor all other questions, please reach out to your school’s coordinator:\n\n\n\nDr. Alexander Fisher\nDuke\naaf29@duke.edu\n\n\nDr. Mario Giacomazzo\nUNC, Chapel Hill\nmgiacoma@email.unc.edu\n\n\nDr. Elijah Meyer\nNorth Carolina State University\nelijah.meyer@duke.edu"
