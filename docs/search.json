Remember that smaller intervals are better since they are more precise; however, you don’t want to be reporting intervals that rarely contain the true point spread. Details about \\(PIW\\) is found below:\n\nIn order for your prediction intervals to be considered, at least 70% of your intervals must contain the true spread. Given this criteria, we heavily recommend reporting intervals with a minimum of 70% coverage. We also recommend testing your methodology on past data to check coverage.\n\n\\[\nPIW = \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| ub_i - lb_i \\right|,& \\text{if Coverage} \\geq 70\\% \\\\\n    & \\\\\n    \\text{Disqualified (DQ)},              & \\text{if Coverage} &lt; 70\\%\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(ub_i\\) is the upper bound of your interval and \\(lb_i\\) is the lower bound of your interval for the spread of the \\(i\\)th game. The average is taken over all \\(n = 78\\) total games for which you are producing prediction intervals. In words, the \\(PIW\\) is the average width of all your prediction intervals. Smaller \\(PIW\\) indicates more precise prediction intervals."
